Hey!

Thanks for expressing interest in Oswald Foundation's internship opportunities.

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Anand Chowdhary, and I'm CEO of Oswald Foundation, India's foremost technology accessibility startup. We're building products like the first smartphone for the blind and the world's most-credited web reading solution for people with dyslexia. We've had the opportunity to be featured by Hindustan Times, The Huffington Post, ScoopWhoop, The Better India, and other leading publications.

What's your interest? Based on that, we can figure out where you can contribute. We're currently looking for people in any of the following categories:
Social media and marketing
Oswald Foundation has currently been working very secretively. With the recent positive reviews and interest from press, we've decided that we should maintain social media profiles and market our products in places. We need interns who can help us do just that, and spread the word to find customers, donors, and people who need our tools.


Event and workshop organization
Oswald Foundation has been invited to organize workshops in special schools, teaching children with learning disabilities computer usage using Oswald tools. We're also going to be organizing a TEDx conference based on accessibility sometime in the last quarter of this year, and we'll need help in organizing these events.


Writing and content creation
Oswald Foundation also plans on launching a blog where we can write about our experiences building these products, the places we've been featured at, and stories of people suffering from disabilities who we could help, and so on. We will also be doing some press releases in the near future, and need help in writing all of that.


Research and development
If you field of interest is related to technology or you're majoring in Computer Science, we could always use a helping hand in the development side of things. We're building some very ground-breaking new technology, and we need people to help us write the code in Android and Web languages like the MEAN stack or Java/Swift.


Business analysis and operations
When you build a company, one of the more important things is managing the business end. Though we have a COO who handles day-to-day operations and finances, we need someone to help us in making a great industry-ready plan for our future partnerships with hardware manufacturers and accessibility companies.
If your field of interest doesn't lie in these broad categories, you should definitely tell me what you like doing, and we'll find a role for you. We're building things that could potentially change the way millions of people spend their days. If you like what we're doing, let's get in touch.

We're also organizing interviews on Sunday, September 4, 2016, in our office at B-100 LGF, Sarvodaya Enclave, New Delhi 110016, which is about half a kilometer from Hauz Khas Metro Station. If you think you can make it, let me know and we'll make a date.

Speaker Profile: My name is Anand Chowdhary, and I founded Oswald Foundation (https://oswald.foundation), India's foremost technology accessibility startup. We're building products like the first smartphone for the blind and the world's most-credited web reading solution for people with dyslexia. I've had the opportunity to be interviewed by Hindustan Times, The Huffington Post, ScoopWhoop, The Better India, and other leading publications.

Talk Topic: Accessibility. Currently, people are completely forgetting the 15% of the world population that suffers from a disability. I'd like to talk about how Oswald Foundation is changing that, and how people should do their bit in helping the disabled. Oswald Foundation is currently working with investors to build the world's first smartphone for the blind. Imagine a person who cannot see anything, making calls, sending messages, listening to music or the news based on only vibration and speech feedback. We're building all this and more.

Speaking Experience: I delivered a keynote address on education technology at Delhi Technological University in 2014. I have also spoken at Worldwide Developer Conference Meetup in Innov8 CP this year.
