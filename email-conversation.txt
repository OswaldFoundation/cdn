Hi Bhavuk,



I hope you're doing well.



Wikipedia is a community-based encyclopedia so the very notion of =22hand=

ling the Treebo hotels Wikipedia page=22 is against her values. Wikipedia=

has a COI policy which strongly discourages people associated with compa=

nies working on the encyclopedia entries of that company.



Please read WP:COI for more information:=C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wi=

ki/Wikipedia:Conflict=5Fof=5Finterest



I'm sure it's no big deal, I plan on redoing in introduction and adding s=

ome more references, and then I'll remove the COI template. It has to sta=

y until someone unbiased and unrelated to Treebo rewrites the article str=

ucture.



Best,
